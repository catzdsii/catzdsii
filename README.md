# Hi there 👋
## About Me
I’m a developer passionate about the Nintendo DS Lite and DSi.  
I enjoy creating custom ROMs and homebrew projects for these consoles, working close to the hardware.

I like building things that run on real devices, experimenting with system limits, and learning more about low-level development.

I also like cats.
