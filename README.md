# Hi there 👋
## About Me
I'm a developer who loves the Nintendo DS Lite and DSi.  
I enjoy creating custom ROMs and projects for these consoles, combining creativity with low-level development.

I know how to develop, experiment, and build things that run on real hardware — not just emulators.

I also really like cats.
